## Synopsis
SmartSimulator is used heavily in 61 countries across the globe . Information on  Application insights and hidden patterns are great insight in developing a scalable web application and future roadmap.


--------------------------------------------------------------
## Value Added
SmartSimulator Application Insights is an insights app which tracks live metrics streams, requests-response times and events for SmartSimulator app. It stores and analyze all operational telemetry in a centralized, fully managed, scalable data store.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Tools used
* AWS Lambda Functions
* AWS Api gateway
* AWS DynamoDB
* AngularJS
* Nodejs

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
## What can we expect-
* SmartSimulator Application Insights is used to track live metrics, response times and events occurring in the SmartSimulator App to be aware as a developer of what our users/customers are liking, using more and what are they missing out on.
* We store and analyze all operational telemetry in a centralized , fully managed ,scalable data store and visualize the data using Angular.js graphs and charts .
* For the backend we use cloud computing comprising of AWS S3, Lambda, Dynamo DB and API gateway to control and manage the insights app. 
* We also have various filters to filter out data and view data according to our region , date and module preferences.
* We test hypotheses and reveal hidden patterns in the usage of the app to find out the reach and security level of the application using the advanced analytic engine.

* The second screenshort is the main dashboard where we see all the errors,responses without any filters but the left navbar can be used to apply filters as in the module names,region,date to track the metrics according to our choice of filters
